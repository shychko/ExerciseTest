# ExerciseTest
A simple test controller and test Spec.

There is no gui component to the project.  There are three files of note.  
/client/js/app.js  (the location of the controller)
/client/tests/CustomTestSpec.js   (the Test class)

To run the tests you have two options 
1.  Using Git Bash shell, or NodeJS command prompt, run the "grunt" command from the /client directory.  
You can also run "karma start".

2.  You can use the /client/tests/SpecRunner.html file.  
Just drop this file in a web browser and it will run the tests.

As always, you can pull down the project using the 
"git clone https://github.com/shychko/ExerciseTest.git" command.

I encourage you to play with the tests and add your own.  It is just a basic shell to get accustomed to testing.
